The Inspiration Behind openTextbook_Highlighter
-------------------------------

openTextbook_Highlighter is a personal project I embarked on during the summer quarter of 2023 at Louisiana Tech University. The development journey spanned from May 2023, to September 2023. I have a deep-rooted interest in enhancing learning efficiency, and I envisioned a tool that could assist students in studying on opensource textbooks, which are predominantly in PDF format. I believed that a feature to leave comments directly on the PDF would facilitate their learning process, leading to the inception of openTextbook_Highlighter.
